# Gambit_test
The Rest api getting the data is the file READ_URL, the rest is related to authentication which I couldnt combine together with gambitlabs data
- Didnt succeed to parse Json (Got an error, that there is unexpected symbol in raw 4, couldnt figure out what is that symbol is and how to modify the data)
- Authentication was very difficult, I used the example from https://medium.com/@prashantramnyc/authenticate-rest-apis-in-node-js-using-jwt-json-web-tokens-f0e97669aad3
- and I couldnt put the solution to the the cloud or VPS
